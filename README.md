# AI Inference via a contanerized app called keras-app
#Keras App is a datascience inference instance using Docker, Python, Keras and Tensorflow with Resnet 50 to identify dog breeds in images. 
#Derived from medium article and deployed to OpenShift (ROSA)

#See the files reamde.txt and commands.txt for more detail: (I'm a fan of Niel Stephenson Reamde.txt is my nod to sci-fi). 
#Derived Keras-app AI inference instance deployable to ROSA. 
#Original Medium Article base below. 
#Modified to local Docker (Mac) and Minikube/OpenShift/ROSA model.
