# AI Inference of a dog breed via a contanerized app 
#Keras App is a datascience inference instance using Docker, Python, Keras and Tensorflow with pre-trained Resnet 50 to identify dog breeds in images. 
#Derived from medium article and deployed to OpenShift (ROSA)

#See the files reamde.txt and commands.txt for more detail: (I'm a fan of Niel Stephenson Reamde.txt is my nod to sci-fi). 
#Derived Keras-app AI inference instance deployable to an AWS resident Managed OpenShift (ROSA) cluster for inference. 
#Original Medium Article base below was different. 
#Modified to local Docker (Mac) and Minikube/OpenShift/ROSA model. 
#yaml versions are in development 

# This uses Python, a Keras container, Tensorflow with the pre-trained Resnet50 image classification model.
